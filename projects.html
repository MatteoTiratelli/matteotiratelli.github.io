<h3>possible student research topics</h3>
<p>Alongside my general interest in the traditional questions of marxist political sociology - power, protest and social history - here are a few topics that might inspire potential research students:</p>
<ul><li>An analysis of party-movement relationships in a country of your choice. There are two obvious approaches: Contentious Relationship Analysis (trawl newspapers or some other corpus to produce a list of interactions, group interactions into relationships between Party X & Movement Y, take relationship as unit of analysis, search for common patterns of relationship development - this is basically an adapted form of PEA); or Case Study (pick particular relationship, e.g. the British Labour Party and the anti-war movement, and produce holistic in-depth study of evolution of that particular relationship).</li>
	<li>An examination of the hermeneutics of Central Bank's Forward Guidance and the interpretive commentary that grows up around each one. This could be quantitative or qualitative in method, but it should be straight forward to gather a corpus of relevant releases from the ECB, BOE and Fed.</li>
	<li>Towards an empirical exploration of 'emotional energy'. A key part of Durkheimian sociology and its modern micro-sociological variants (e.g. Randall Collins), the metaphor of 'emotional energy' is often applied to social movements & revolutionary moments. But although we can recognise it when we see it, the concept has not yet been operationalised in a satisfactory way. This is a big challenge but an important one. For some starting points see: <a href="https://matteotiratelli.substack.com/p/the-temporal-dynamics-of-emotional">[1]</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9558.2004.00204.x">[2]</a>, <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/692782">[3]</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1qbutEvXGugY6MUFhANmlYAL66VFBd0/view">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
