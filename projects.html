<h3>research topics</h3>
<p>Alongside my general interest in the traditional questions of marxist political sociology - power, protest and social history - here are a few topics that might inspire potential research students:</p>
<ul><li>An analysis of party-movement relationships. There are two obvious approaches: Contentious Relationship Analysis (trawl newspapers or some other corpus to produce a list of interactions, group interactions into relationships between Party X & Movement Y, take the relationship as unit of analysis, search for common patterns of relationship development - this is basically an adapted form of PEA); or Case Study (pick particular relationship, e.g. the British Labour Party and the anti-war movement, and produce holistic in-depth study of evolution of that particular relationship).
	<br></li>
	<li>An examination of the hermeneutics of Central Bank's Forward Guidance and the interpretive commentary that grows up around each one. This could be quantitative or qualitative in method, but it should be straight forward to gather a corpus of relevant releases from the ECB, BOE and Fed.
	<br></li>
	<li>An empirical exploration of 'emotional energy'. A key part of Durkheimian sociology and its modern micro-sociological variants (see e.g. Randall Collins), the metaphor of 'emotional energy' is often applied to social movements & revolutionary moments. But although we can recognise it when we see it, the concept has not yet been operationalised in a satisfactory way. This is a big challenge but an important one. For some starting points see: <a href="https://github.com/MatteoTiratelli/TimeDynamicsEmotionalEnergy">[1]</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9558.2004.00204.x">[2]</a>, <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/692782">[3]</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1qbutEvXGugY6MUFhANmlYAL66VFBd0/view">[4]</a>
	<br></li>
	<li>Scholars and activists have often commented on the important role of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108504">"free spaces"</a> or <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8675.1994.tb00004.x?casa_token=4us67x0aH-YAAAAA%3AOahfOCV7pA-eCIq5KCcMWlxMVq-ZAntzcr1RMYWbUlnAzcIOxcLjyP5F6p6m5bzgaDqk_9QhrTGHAQ">"oppositional enclaves"</a> in the development of social movements. The word space is often used as a metaphor, but it this case these free spaces are often physical: community centres, churches, squats, social centres, etc. What interests me is the fact that the availability of these physical spaces is largely determined by urban political economy. Several questions therefore suggest themselves: Are changes to urban political economy and the availability of these kind of civic spaces a kind of "opportunity structure" for movements? Do particular kinds of spaces lead movements to develop in particular directions (in other words, are there any common patterns of movement development depending on the kinds of spaces they inhabit)? Has the securitisation and privatisation of cities led to a decline in movements (if not, why not)? Can particular spaces function as a kind of "abeyance structure"? Some of these questions could be quantified if appropriate measures of available spaces & mobilisation can be found for a particular city/region. Other would lend themselves to careful case study analysis.
